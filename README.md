# Rules:
When it’s your turn to play, you’ll be able to roll the dice up to 3 times, choosing which dice you want to re-roll or keep the same.

You’ll also be able to interrupt your turn at any time before the third roll, but you’ll have to fill a number in your scorecard by the end of your turn.

Once each player finishes their turn by writing something on the scorecard, the next person takes their turn.

The cycle continues until everyone has filled all 13 boxes on their scorecard, and a final point tally has been taken.

The person with the highest score is the winner.


You’re trying to get 12 different combinations out of the five dice, and you get a specific number of points for each of the combinations that you roll.

Each combination has its own slot on the scorecard, and the aim is to fill each slot with the maximum number of points allowed for your combination.

Winning Yahtzee relies on a combination of strategy, and skilled rolling.

You’ll have up to three rolls on each of your turns to help you get the combination that you want, and you can also choose to keep as many dice as you like from each roll.

# Scoring
In the upper section of the scorecard, you’ll be able to add the total of the dice that applies to the number that you want to record your score for.

If you roll 4 threes and want to use this in the upper section for the number 3, you would get 12 points.

The lower section of the score card has different rules for different categories.

If you roll a four-of-a-kind or a three-of-a-kind your score will be the sum of all the dice, including the ones that aren’t contained in your 3 or 4 of a kind.

A small straight – 4 dice in order, is worth 30 points, while a large straight is worth 40 points (5 dice in order). If you get a Yahtzee (all of the same dice) then you can get 50 points. Point scores for each section include:

Aces: combine the value of all dice with a 1
Twos: combine the value of all dice with a 2
Threes combine the value of all dice with a 3
Fours: combine the value of all dice with a 4
Fives: combine the value of all dice with a 5
Sixes: combine the value of all dice with a 6
3 of a kind: 3 of the same number value plus the value of the remaining dice
4 of a kind: 4 of the same number plus the remaining dice value
Small straight: 30 points (4 dice in sequence)
Large straight: 40 points (5 dice in chain)
Yahtzee: Five of the same number: 50 points
Chance: Sum of all five dice


There’s one final rule to keep in mind when you’re playing Yahtzee – and that’s to yell Yahtzee when you score five dice of the same value.
Half of the fun of the game is shouting out the title when you roll a fantastic combination.
Although some people don’t force this rule, it’s a great way to open people up and have some more fun when you’re playing the gam
